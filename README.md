# extendJS

A tiny little library providing broad flexibility for extending objects in Javascript. Originally intended for use with requirejs (to avoid all functions behind defined as closures), it will hopefully be flexible enough for general use when building mixins/multiple inheritance or simply defining the prototype of your class.

(26.07.2011) this code has never been so much as parsed, let alone tested! It has been javascript linted though... (jslint doesn't seem to support multiple var declarations in a function)
